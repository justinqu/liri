LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface,
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and 
gives you back data.
create a file named .env, add the following to it, replacing the values with your API keys (no quotes) once you have them:
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret

# Twitter API keys

TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your-twitter-consumer-key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-twitter-consumer-secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=your-access-token-key
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-twitter-access-token-secret

This file will be used by the dotenv package to set what are known as environment variables to the global process.env object in node. These are values that are meant to be specific to the computer that node is running on, and since we are gitignoring this file, they won't be pushed to github â€” keeping our API key information private.
If someone wanted to clone your app from github and run it themselves, they would need to supply their own .env file for it to work.



Get your Twitter API keys by following these steps:



Step One: Visit https://apps.twitter.com/app/new
Step Two: Fill out the form with dummy data. Type http://google.com in the Website input. Don't fill out the Callback URL input. Then submit the form.

Copy and paste them into your .env file, replacing the your-twitter-consumer-key and your-twitter-consumer-secret placeholders.



Step Four: At the bottom of the page, click the Create my access token button to get your access token key and secret. 


Copy the access token key and secret displayed at the bottom of the next screen. Paste them into your .env file, replacing the placeholders for your-twitter-access-token-key and your-twitter-access-token-secret.
